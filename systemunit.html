					UNIT</h1>

				<p>
					<img src="images/systemu.jpg"> <br> The system unit,
					like the one above is the case that contains all the electronic
					components of any computer system. <br>The electronic
					components are considered internal hardware seeing that they are
					inside the system unit and you cannot see when you look at the
					computer.<br> These components inside the system unit are what
					process the data and really makes the computer work.
				</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: blue; color: white">Internal
					components are as follow</h3>

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Power Supply</h2>
				<p>
					The power supply converts electricity into the current works for
					the computer. When the computer is turned on the power supply
					allows converted electricity to travel to other components inside
					the computer.<br> <img alt="POwer Supply"

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Motherboard</h2>
				<p>
					The motherboard is the circuit board that holds the main internal
					components of the computer together. On the motherboard there are
					three major cards; sound card that operates the sound, the video
					card that handles the graphics that you see on the monitor and the
					modem card which allows computers to communicate with each other.
					Also on the motherboard is the Central Processing Unit (CPU),
					processor or brain of the computer. The CPU controls information
					and tells the other components inside the computer what to do.<br>

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">RAM's</h2>
				<p>
					RAM stands for random access memory. This memory holds the
					information you are working with while the computer is turned on.
					Once you turn the computer off all the information that was in RAM
					will be gone. ROM stands for read only memory. This memory holds
					information that you can only read, but not erase. Information in
					ROM is built in and is always there even when the computer is
					turned off.<br> <img alt="RAM" src="images/ram.jpg"

				<p>
					RAM(Random Access Memory) is a part of computer's Main Memory which
					is directly accessible by CPU. RAM is used to Read and Write data
					into it which is accessed by CPU randomly. RAM is volatile in
					nature, it means if the power goes off, the stored information is
					lost. RAM is used to store the data that is currently processed by
					the CPU. Most of the programs and data that are modifiable are
					stored in RAM.<br> Integrated RAM chips are available in two
					form:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>SRAM(Static RAM)</li>
					<li>DRAM(Dynamic RAM)</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">SRAM</h3>
				<p>
					The SRAM memories consist of circuits capable of retaining the
					stored information as long as the power is applied. That means this
					type of memory requires constant power. SRAM memories are used to
					build Cache Memory.<br> SRAM Memory Cell: Static
					memories(SRAM) are memories that consist of circuits capable of
					retaining their state as long as power is on. Thus this type of
					memories is called volatile memories. The below figure shows a cell
					diagram of SRAM. A latch is formed by two inverters connected as
					shown in the figure. Two transistors T1 and T2 are used for
					connecting the latch with two bit lines. The purpose of these
					transistors is to act as switches that can be opened or closed
					under the control of the word line, which is controlled by the
					address decoder. When the word line is at 0-level, the transistors
					are turned off and the latch remains its information. For example,
					the cell is at state 1 if the logic value at point A is 1 and at
					point B is 0. This state is retained as long as the word line is
					not activated.<br> For Read operation, the word line is
					activated by the address input to the address decoder. The
					activated word line closes both the transistors (switches) T1 and
					T2. Then the bit values at points A and B can transmit to their
					respective bit lines. The sense/write circuit at the end of the bit
					lines sends the output to the processor.<br> For Write
					operation, the address provided to the decoder activates the word
					line to close both the switches. Then the bit value that to be
					written into the cell is provided through the sense/write circuit
					and the signals in bit lines are then stored in the cell.
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">DRAM</h3>
				<p>
					DRAM stores the binary information in the form of electric charges
					that applied to capacitors. The stored information on the
					capacitors tend to lose over a period of time and thus the
					capacitors must be periodically recharged to retain their usage.
					The main memory is generally made up of DRAM chips.<br> DRAM
					Memory Cell: Though SRAM is very fast, but it is expensive because
					of its every cell requires several transistors. Relatively less
					expensive RAM is DRAM, due to the use of one transistor and one
					capacitor in each cell, as shown in the below figure., where C is
					the capacitor and T is the transistor. Information is stored in a
					DRAM cell in the form of a charge on a capacitor and this charge
					needs to be periodically recharged.<br> For storing
					information in this cell, transistor T is turned on and an
					appropriate voltage is applied to the bit line. This causes a known
					amount of charge to be stored in the capacitor. After the
					transistor is turned off, due to the property of the capacitor, it
					starts to discharge. Hence, the information stored in the cell can
					be read correctly only if it is read before the charge on the
					capacitors drops below some threshold value.<br>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Types of DRAM</h3>
				<p>
					There are mainly 5 types of DRAM:<br> <font size="4">Asynchronous
						DRAM (ADRAM):</font> The DRAM described above is the asynchronous type
					DRAM. The timing of the memory device is controlled asynchronously.
					A specialized memory controller circuit generates the necessary
					control signals to control the timing. The CPU must take into
					account the delay in the response of the memory.<br> <font
						size="4">Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM):</font>These RAM chips access
					speed is directly synchronized with the CPU's clock. For this, the
					memory chips remain ready for operation when the CPU expects them
					to be ready. These memories operate at the CPU-memory bus without
					imposing wait states. SDRAM is commercially available as modules
					incorporating multiple SDRAM chips and forming the required
					capacity for the modules.<br> <font size="4">Double-Data-Rate
						SDRAM (DDR SDRAM):</font> This faster version of SDRAM performs its
					operations on both edges of the clock signal; whereas a standard
					SDRAM performs its operations on the rising edge of the clock
					signal. Since they transfer data on both edges of the clock, the
					data transfer rate is doubled. To access the data at high rate, the
					memory cells are organized into two groups. Each group is accessed
					separately.<br> <font size="4">Rambus DRAM (RDRAM):</font>The
					RDRAM provides a very high data transfer rate over a narrow
					CPU-memory bus. It uses various speedup mechanisms, like
					synchronous memory interface, caching inside the DRAM chips and
					very fast signal timing. The Rambus data bus width is 8 or 9 bits.<br>
					<font size="4">Cache DRAM (CDRAM):</font>This memory is a special
					type DRAM memory with an on-chip cache memory (SRAM) that acts as a
					high-speed buffer for the main DRAM.<br>

					<tr>
						<td>SRAM</td>
						<td>DRAM</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>SRAM has lower access time, so it is faster compared to
							DRAM</td>
						<td>DRAM has higher access time, so it is slower than SRAM</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>SRAM is costlier than DRAM</td>
						<td>DRAM costs less compared to SRAM</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>SRAM requires constant power supply, which means this

							that the information is stored in the capacitor.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Due to complex internal circuitry, less storage capacity
							is available compared to the same physical size of DRAM memory
							chip</td>
						<td>Due to small internal circuitry in the one-bit memory

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Disk Drives</h2>
				<p>The disk drive is the device that reads information that is
					on disk. Generally speaking most computers have three disk drives;
					hard disk drive, floppy disk drive and CD-Rom drive. However, there
					computers that have DVD-Rom drive. While the hard disk is hidden
					inside the computer the floppy and CD-Rom drives are accessible
					from the front of the system unit.<br>
