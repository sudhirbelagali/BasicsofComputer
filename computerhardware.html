				<h1 style="background-color: green; color: white">COMPUTER
					HARDWARE</h1>

				<p>
					You learned earlier that a computer has electronic and mechanical
					parts known as hardware.<br> Hardware also includes input
					devices, output devices, system unit, storage devices and<br>
					communication devices. Without these components we would not be
					able to use the computer.
				</p>
				<h2 style="background-color: blue; color: white">Input Devices</h2>
				<p>
					An input device is any hardware component that allows you the user
					to enter data into the computer.<br> There are many input
					devices. Six of the most widely used input devices are:
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Keyboard</h3>
				<p>
					A computer keyboard is one of the primary input devices used with a
					computer. Similar to an electric typewriter, a keyboard is composed
					of buttons that create letters, numbers, and symbols, as well as
					perform other functions. The following sections provide more
					in-depth information and answers to some of the more frequently
					asked questions about the keyboard.<br> The following image
					shows a 104-key keyboard with arrows pointing to each section,
					including the control keys, function keys, LED indicators, wrist
					pad, arrow keys, and keypad.<br> <img
						src="images/keyboardoverview.png" width="600" align="middle"><br>
				</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Types of
					keyboards</h3>
				<p>

					Today, most keyboards are similar to each other, but may be missing
					one or more of the sections mentioned earlier (e.g., the keypad).
					Where keyboards begin to differ the most is with their
					constructions. Some keyboards are mechanical, while others use
					membrane keys. Some keyboards are split down the middle and others
					even fold in half or roll up. While most keyboards use
					the QWERTYlayout, there are still people who use the DVORAK layout.<br>
				</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Laptop
					keyboards</h3>
				<p>
					</>A laptop keyboard is arranged differently than
					a desktop keyboard to accommodate the laptop's narrower footprint.
					Most laptop keyboards are made smaller by placing the keys closer
					and by including an Fn key. The Fn key is used in conjunction with
					other keys to perform special functions. For example, pressing the
					Fn key and the up or down arrow on the keyboard shown below,
					increases and decreases the screen brightness. Furthermore, many
					laptop keyboards omit the numeric keypad to save space.<br> <img
						alt="Laptop Keyboard" src="images/laptopkeyboard.jpeg" width="400">
				</p>


				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Smartphone
					and tablet keyboards</h3>
				<p>

					Today's smartphones and tablets do not come with a physical
					keyboard, although it may be purchased as an
					optional peripheral add-on. These devices utilize a thumb
					keyboard or on-screen keyboard to type messages and enter text into
					various fields. The image is an example of the
					Apple iPhoneon-screen keyboard, used on all Apple touch-based
					devices.<br> <img alt="SmartPhone Keyboard"
						src="images/smartphonekeyboard.gif"><br>
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Multimedia
					Keyboard</h3>
				<p>
					The keyboard that has all multimedia buttons is called multimedia
					keyboard. The buttons include play, pause, previous, next, volume
					up, volume down, mute and special button to launch media. Also, a
					button to launch a browser, my computer, calculator is available.<br>
					<img alt="Multimedia Keyboard" src="images/multimediakeyboard.jpg">
				</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Mechanical
					Keyboard</h3>
				<p>
					The primitive keyboard which uses physical buttons for each key is
					called a mechanical keyboard. It makes noise when each key is
					pressed. A button is pushed down and an electrical signal is sent
					to the computer device which then shows the characters.<br> <img
						src="images/qwerty.png" width="580" align="middle"><br>
				</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Wireless
					Keyboard</h3>
				<p>
					Bluetooth, IR technology or Radio Frequency is used to connect the
					keyboard with the computer device. We can port the keyboard and the
					parent system is not needed near the keyboard. These keyboards are
					lightweight and smaller in size. These keyboards should have a
					transmitter and trans-receiver. Transmitter sends the strokes from
					the keyboard as radio waves which are received by trans-receiver
					kept near parent device.<br> <img alt="Wireless Keyboard"
						src="images/wirelesskeyboard.jpg" width="400">
				</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Virtual
					Keyboard</h3>
				<p>
					The keyboard used in smartphones is called a virtual keyboard. This
					keyboard appears when needed and disappears when typing is
					completed. This can be automatically set as per need. Also in the
					windows system, we can use a virtual keyboard that appears on the
					screen. There is no physical object to carry for a virtual
					keyboard.<br> <img alt="Virtual Keyboard"
						src="images/virtualkeyboard.jpg" width="400">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">USB Keyboard</h3>
				<p>
					Universal Serial Bus Keyboard has a USB stick with a wire which has
					to be inserted into the USB port of the system. And then the
					keyboard works well. While rebooting the system, the keyboard is
					not supported and hence the users may face an issue. Installation
					of suitable drivers helps to resolve this issue.<br> <img
						alt="USB Keyboard" src="images/usbkeyboard.jpg">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Ergonomic
					Keyboard</h3>
				<p>
					This keyboard is mainly designed for users who use both hands for
					typing. The advantage of this keyboard is less muscle strain and
					carpal tunnel syndrome for users. The keyboard is built with the
					view of ergonomics. This keyboard is expensive and not affordable
					for common people.<br> <img alt="USB Keyboard"
						src="images/ergonomickeyboard.jpg" width="500">
				</p>


				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">2. A Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					The mouse is a pointing device that has a pointer that changes into
					different shapes as you use the mouse. You click the mouse by
					pressing and releasing the button. This action allows you to enter
					data when using a mouse.<br> A computer mouse is a hand held
					hardware input device that controls a cursor in a GUI (graphical
					user interface) and can move and select text, icons, files,
					and folders on your computer.<br> For desktop computers, the
					mouse is placed on a flat surface (e.g., mouse pad or desk) in
					front of your computer. The picture is an example of a desktop
					computer mouse with two buttons and a wheel.<br> <img
						src="images/mouse.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: blue; color: white">Types of mouse</h3>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Wired Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					This is your average, run of the mill, basic mouse that connects to
					your PC with a USB wire.<br> <img alt="Wired Mouse"
						src="images/wiredmouse.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Wireless
					Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					A wireless mouse is just the same as its predecessor, but without
					its tail.<br> <img alt="Wireless Mouse"
						src="images/wirelessmouse.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Ball or
					Mechanical Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					This was one of the first mice seen used with computers. It used a
					rubber ball to track motion the ball would spin in the direction
					you moved the mouse and the sensor detected it to determine what
					way to move the cursor. This mouse is quite out-dated and rarely
					seen being used anymore.<br> <img alt="Mechanical Mouse"
						src="images/ballmouse.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Wheel/Scroll
					Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					The wheel mouse can come in all forms; wireless, optical, wired and
					more. The wheel refers to the tiny wheel attached between the left
					and right click buttons, which allows you to scroll up and down
					pages without manually having to use the scroll option on the side
					of the page.<br> <img alt="Wheel Mouse"
						src="images/wheelmouse.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Optical Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					This is the most commonly seen computer mice these days. It uses an
					LED light at the bottom of the device where the old rubber ball in
					a mechanical mouse would exist. The LED detects movement through
					reflected light. This means the mouse does not work on all
					surfaces; clear glass and plastic surfaces are not ideal<br> <img
						alt="Optical Mouse" src="images/opticalmouse.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Laser Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					This works much in the same way as an optical mouse. However, it
					does not use an LED; instead it uses a laser beam to reflect light
					from the surface it is on. This mouse can be used on surfaces like
					glass and plastic, but it is not as accurate as an optical mouse. <br>
					<img alt="Laser Mouse" src="images/lasermouse.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">BlueTrack
					Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					The BlueTrack mouse was invented by Microsoft; it houses a unique
					technology that uses a combination of image sensor and pixel
					geometry to accurately detect movement on all types of surfaces. <br>
					<img alt="BlueTrack Mouse" src="images/bluetrackmouse.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Touchpad</h3>
				<p>
					These are most commonly found on laptops. Also referred to as glide
					pads, they have flat surfaces that require the touch of a finger
					gliding on them to control the cursor. Though touch pads usually
					have two buttons, some are pressure-sensitive and can be used as
					buttons by tapping the flat surface.<br> <img alt="Touchpad"
						src="images/laptoptouchpad.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Trackball
					Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					A trackball mouse looks like an old mechanical mouse inverted. The
					ball is featured on the top of the mouse and is used to guide the
					cursor by spinning it.<br> <img alt="Trackball Mouse"
						src="images/trackballmouse.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Gaming Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					These mice often feature multiple buttons, which can be programmed
					for gaming purposes. They are sturdy, and made for long-time use.<br>
					<img alt="Gaming Mouse" src="images/gamingmouse.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Vertical
					Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					This is a very strange looking mouse. It sits upright and is meant
					to be held with your hand. This design is meant to be a lot more
					ergonomic than the regular mouse, being better for long-term
					computer use.<br> <img alt="Vertical Mouse"
						src="images/verticalmouse.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Stylus Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					These are expensive alternatives to your regular mouse are not used
					by the average Joe. These are specifically meant for digital
					designers. It is the perfect combination of a pen and a mouse, and
					great for those who free-hand draw on their PCs.<br> <img
						alt="Stylus Mouse" src="images/stylusmouse.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Track point
					Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					Have you ever wondered what those red or grey rubber spheres
					between the "G" "H" and "B" keys on some laptops are? Those are
					track point mice. <br> <img alt="Track-point Mouse"
						src="images/trackpointmouse.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Foot Mouse</h3>
				<p>
					This is the weirdest mouse on this list and probably the least
					common of the lot. This allows the PC user to navigate the cursor
					with their feet so they don't have to remove their hands from the
					keyboard-talk about efficient<br> <img alt="Foot Mouse"
						src="images/footmouse.png">
				</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">3. A Scanner</h3>
				<p>
					This input device copies from paper into your computer.<br> <img
						src="images/scanner.jpg"><br>
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: blue; color: white">Types of
					scanners</h3>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Flatbed
					Scanners</h3>
				<p>
					Flatbed scanners are some of the most commonly used scanners as it
					has both home and office functions.  <br> <img
						alt="Flatbed scanner" src="images/flatbedscanner.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Sheet-Fed
					Scanners</h3>
				<p>
					Sheet-fed scanners cost between $300 and $800. This type of scanner
					works like a flatbed scanner except that the image is fed through
					the scanner and moves along the beam to be read rather than the
					beam moving. <br> <img alt="Sheet-Fed Scanners"
						src="images/sheetfedscanner.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Integrated
					Scanners</h3>
				<p>
					Integrated scanners are becoming one of the most modern types of
					scanners when it comes to obtaining images. ATMs feature this type
					of built-in scanner for check-processing and approval. <br> <img
						alt="Integrated Scanners" src="images/integratedscanner.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Drum Scanners</h3>
				<p>
					These types of scanners are used mainly for capturing a picture and
					producing at a very high resolution rate. <br> <img
						alt="Drum Scanners" src="images/drumscanner.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Portable
					Scanners</h3>
				<p>
					Portable scanner are designed to capture text and other data while
					you are on the go. <br> <img alt="Portable Scanners"
						src="images/portablescanner.png">
				</p>




				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">4 . A
					Microphone</h3>
				<p>
					The microphone is usually used for voice input into the computer.<br>
					<img src="images/microphone.jpg" height="300" width="500">
				</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">5. A Digital
					Camera</h3>
				<p>
					The digital camera allows you to take pictures that you can input
					into your computer. <br> <img src="images/camera.jpg"
						height="300" width="500"><br>
				</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">6. A PC Video
					Camera</h3>
				<p>
					The PC video camera allows you take both video<br> and still
					images that you can input onto your computer.<br> <img
						src="images/vcam.jpg"><br>
				</p>

				<h2 style="background-color: blue; color: white">Output Devices</h2>

				<p>
					An output device is any hardware component that gives information
					to the user. <br> Three commonly used output devices are as
					follow:
				</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">1. A Monitor</h3>
				<p>
					This output device displays your information on a screen<br> <img
						src="images/monitor.jpg" width="600" height="500"> <br>
				</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Types of
					Monitor</h3>
				<p>he type of monitor that you use on a PC can influence your
					workspace and your wallet. A few screens can be acquired on a
					spending limit, while others are genuinely costly. Various
					assortments of screen additionally have distinctive vitality
					prerequisites and visual characteristics. By considering the
					advantages and disadvantages of these four regular PC shows, you
					can locate the correct screen for the activity.</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Cathode Ray
					Tube:</h3>
				<p>
					The cathode beam cylinder screen is one of the oldest types of
					Computer display devices. CRT PC screens have been being used since
					the 1950s, are as yet utilized today. This kind of screen utilizes
					a light emission to enlighten various territories of the screen.
					The shaft moves to and fro quickly, and refreshes the screen
					picture ordinarily each second. <br>CRT monitors are
					moderately reasonable and dependable. Be that as it may, they are
					added to some degree unwieldy and substantial. Consequently, they
					are typically the not first decision for establishments that
					require a dainty and unpretentious screen. <br> <img
						alt="Cathode Ray Tube:" src="images/crtmonitor.jpg" width="600">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Liquid-Crystal
					Display:</h3>
				<p>
					Fluid precious stone showcase screens use a layer of pixels to show
					a picture. Rather than an electron bar, LCD showcases utilize
					straightforward anodes to control the variety of pixels and update
					the image. This permits LCD screens to be a lot more slender than
					their CRT partners. An LCD shows likewise require less power than a
					customary CRT.<br> LCD monitors do have a few inconveniences,
					be that as it may. They are regularly more costly than CRT shows.
					The picture can likewise wind up blackout if the screen is seen
					from a point. Indeed, even with these disadvantages, LCD screens
					have generally supplanted CRTs as of late. <br> <img
						alt="Liquid-Crystal Display:" src="images/lcd.jpeg" width="600">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Light-Emitting
					Diode</h3>
				<p>
					A light-emanating diode screen is basically an overhauled
					adaptation of an LCD show. Both LCD and LED screens utilize
					straightforward terminals to control various pixels. In an LED
					showcase, be that as it may, light emanating diodes are set behind
					the screen and go about as a backdrop illumination. This builds the
					definition and splendor of the screen.<br> Driven screens
					utilize less power than both LCD and CRT screens. This makes them
					perfect for vitality delicate gadgets, for example, workstations
					and tablets. These advantages come at an assembling cost that is
					higher than different screens, in any case. <br> <img
						alt="Light-Emitting Diode" src="images/led.jpg" width="600">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Plasma
					Display Panel</h3>
				<p>
					Plasma show board screens utilize little cells of charged gases to
					make a picture. These cells are like family bright lights. Every
					plasma cell makes its very own enlightenment, which disposes of the
					requirement for a different backdrop illumination and gives PDP
					screens solid differentiation. <br></>A plasma screen is
					commonly heavier than an LCD show. Plasma screens additionally draw
					more power than both LCD and LED screens, and are defenseless to
					"copied in" pictures in the event that they are left on for
					extensive stretches of time. <br> <img
						alt="Plasma Display Panel" src="images/plasma.jpg" width="600">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">2. A Printer</h3>
				<p>
					This output device prints information on paper.This type of printed
					output is called a hard copy<br> <img src="images/printer.jpg"
						align="middle"><br>
				</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: blue; color: white">Types of
					printer</h3>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Laser
					Printers</h3>
				<p>
					The laser printer was developed by Xerox in the 1960s when the idea
					of using a laser to draw images onto a copier drum was first
					considered. Laser printers are still widely used in large offices
					as they are traditionally more efficient than inkjet printers. <br>
					<img alt="Laser Printers" src="images/laserprinter.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Solid Ink
					Printers</h3>
				<p>
					Solid ink printers utilise a unique form of ink technology,
					designed to save space and money on packaging. The printers melt
					solid ink sticks during the printing process - a method which can
					help produce more vibrant tones. <br> <img
						alt="Solid Ink Printers" src="images/solidinkprinter.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">LED Printers</h3>
				<p>
					LED printers are similar to laser printers but use a light emitting
					diode rather than a laser to create images on the print drum or
					belt. Due to their fewer moving parts - LED printers are often
					considered more efficient and reliable than laser printers. <br>
					<img alt="LED Printer" src="images/ledprinter.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Business
					Inkjet Printers</h3>
				<p>
					Utilising inkjet technology on a large scale to accommodate the
					needs of a busy office with heavy reliance on printed output,
					inkjet printers are enduringly popular due to their reliability and
					robust nature. <br> <img alt="Business Inkjet Printers"
						src="images/businessinkjetprinter.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Inkjet
					printers</h3>
				<p>
					Inkjet printers are one of the most common types of printer used in
					both professional and domestic settings. Developed in the 1950s,
					inkjet printing technology is still hugely popular today due to its
					numerous advantages and minimal drawbacks. <br> <img
						alt="Inkjet printers" src="images/inkjetprinter.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Multifunction
					printer</h3>
				<p>
					Sometimes known as all-in-one printers, multifunction printers are
					often capable of performing printing, copying, scanning, and faxing
					tasks. This can simplify the completion of multiple tasks within an
					office or domestic environment, with no need for more than one unit
					<br> <img alt="Multifunction Printer"
						src="images/multifunctionprinter.png">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">Dot Matrix</h3>
				<p>
					Dot matrix printers are the oldest established type of printers
					still available on the market. Images and text are drawn out in
					tiny dots when a print head strikes an ink-soaked cloth against the
					paper in the required pattern or formation. <br> <img
						alt="Dot Matrix" src="images/dotmatrixprinter.png">
				</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: black; color: white">3.A Speaker</h3>
				<p>
					Sound is the type of output you will get from a speaker.<br> <img
						src="images/speaker.png" width="600" height="500"><br>
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: blue; color: white">Types of
					speakers</h3>
				<p>The traditional loudspeaker as we know it has been around
					since the dawn of electronic audio. Having said that, it has
					adapted and evolved significantly over the years, and can now be
					found in a range of shapes, sizes and variations to suit a wide
					variety of decors and applications. The four main types of speaker
					found in the home these days are traditional loudspeakers,
					in-wall/ceiling speakers, soundbars and subwoofers. Each type of
					speaker serves a different purpose and is useful for different
					applications.</p>

				<h3 style="background-color: blue; color: white">Loudspeakers</h3>
				<p>
					If you were asked to picture a speaker, a loudspeaker is probably
					what you'd imagine; they've been around for decades and are still
					considered the standard when it comes to audio reproduction as they
					are versatile with placement and application. In their traditional
					form, loudspeakers are most commonly found in pairs as floor
					standing or bookshelf style speakers, however, surround sound
					speakers are also just a slight variation on the classic
					loudspeaker. <br> <img alt="Loudspeakers"
						src="images/loudspeaker.jpg" width="600">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: blue; color: white">Subwoofers</h3>
				<p>
					A subwoofer is a loudspeaker that is dedicated to reproducing the
					low frequency band of your audio - such as the rumbling bass sounds
					in your movies and the bass guitar from your music. General
					loudspeakers don't cater for these low frequencies, so a dedicated
					subwoofer is needed if you want to do justice to the full audio
					spectrum. <br> <img alt="Subwoofers"
						src="images/subwoofers.jpg" width="600">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: blue; color: white">In
					wall/ceiling speakers</h3>
				<p>
					To preserve your room's decor, you can also opt for in-wall or
					in-ceiling speakers. They work like a like a regular speaker but
					are mounted in a frame and set into your wall. These are great
					because they can still produce high quality sound whilst being
					hidden from view. <br> <img alt="In wall/ceiling speakers"
						src="images/inwall.webp" width="600">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: blue; color: white">Soundbars</h3>
				<p>
					If all you're after is a more dynamic sound from your TV without
					having to place speakers around your room or embed them in your
					walls, then a soundbar may be an adequate option for you. Sound
					bars have a sleek design to complement most flat panel LCD, LED and
					plasma TVs, and usually provide a much better sound than the set
					in-built speakers. They can also imitate the experience achieved by
					5.1 and 7.1 surround systems, as a soundbar contains several
					speakers in the one housing that are positioned to bounce sound off
					the walls and send audio around your room. <br> <img
						alt="Soundbars" src="images/soundbars.jpg" width="600">
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: blue; color: white">Outdoor
					speakers</h3>
				<p>
					If you want to enjoy music in the garden or by the pool, there are
					purpose-designed speakers that can resist the extreme variations in
					temperature and humidity experienced outdoors, and can even
					withstand some exposure to water. Outdoor speakers come in robust
					cases, normally with metal grilles to protect speaker cones from
					environmental attack, and use polypropylene materials in their
					speaker cones, rather than humidity-sensitive paper pulp. <br>
