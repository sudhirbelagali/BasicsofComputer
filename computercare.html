					computer have to be cared for. Scanning, defragging and
					reformatting are some of the activities performed to clean up the
					hard drive. These activities are best left to a grown up and such
					you should not attempt them. However, there are certain tasks you
					can perform to ensure you computer is clean; here are a few:</p>
