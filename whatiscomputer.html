					FUNDAMENTALS</h1>

				<p>A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out
					sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via
					computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow
					generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs
					enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A
					"complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system
					(main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for
					"full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term
					may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and
					work together, in particular a computer network or computer
					cluster.</p>
				<p>Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of
					industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special
					purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory
					devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design, and
					also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile
					devices such as smart phones. The Internet is run on computers and
					it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their
					users. Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices.
					Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the abacus aided
					people in doing calculations. Early in the Industrial Revolution,
					some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks,
					such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical
					machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th
					century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were
					developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors
					in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS
					transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip
					technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and
					the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and
					versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever
					since then, with MOS transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace
					(as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution
					during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.</p>
				<p>Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one
					processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in
					the form of a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) microprocessor, along
					with some type of computer memory, typically MOS semiconductor
					memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and
					logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change
					the order of operations in response to stored information.
					Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice,
					joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.),
					and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the
					2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be
					retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of
					operations to be saved and retrieved.</p>
				<p>A computer is an electronic machine that accepts data, stores
					and processes data into information. The computer is able to work
					because there are instructions in its memory directing it.</p>
				<p>The parts of the computer that you can see and touch, such as
					the keyboard, monitor and the mouse are called hardware. The
					instructions that direct the computer are called software or
					computer program.</p>
				<p>Data which is raw facts that you the user enter into the
					computer is called input. This includes; words, numbers, sound and
					pictures. When the data is entered into the computer, the computer
					processes the data to produce information which is output. For
					example, you enter 2+2 into the computer as data, the computer
					processes it and the result is 4 which is information.</p>

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Personal
					Computer (PC)</h2>
				<p>This is the computer that most people use in their daily
					lives. This computer is much smaller, less powerful and less
					expensive than the supercomputer and the mainframe computer. There
					are two main types of personal computers. Macintosh (Macs) and the
					PC compatibles (PC). The main differences between the two are the
					operating systems and the processor they use. This category of
					computer has two additional types of computers. These are mobile
					computer and handheld computer. The most popular type of mobile
					computer is the notebook or laptop computer, and the handheld
					computer is a very small PC that you can hold in your hand.</p>
				<p>It is important to note that, any computer; regardless of its
					size has an input device, output device and a system unit.</p>
				<p>A PC can be defined as a small, relatively inexpensive
					computer designed for an individual user. PCs are based on the
					microprocessor technology that enables manufacturers to put an
					entire CPU on one chip. Businesses use personal computers for word
					processing, accounting, desktop publishing, and for running
					spreadsheet and database management applications. At home, the most
					popular use for personal computers is playing games and surfing the
					Internet.</p>
				<p>Although personal computers are designed as single-user
					systems, these systems are normally linked together to form a
					network. In terms of power, now-a-days high-end models of the
					Macintosh and PC offer the same computing power and graphics
					capability as low-end workstations by Sun Microsystems,
					Hewlett-Packard, and Dell.</p>
				<br> <img alt="Personal Computer"

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Workstation</h2>
				<p>Workstation is a computer used for engineering applications
					(CAD/CAM), desktop publishing, software development, and other such
					types of applications which require a moderate amount of computing
					power and relatively high quality graphics capabilities.

					Workstations generally come with a large, high-resolution graphics
					screen, large amount of RAM, inbuilt network support, and a
					graphical user interface. Most workstations also have mass storage
					device such as a disk drive, but a special type of workstation,
					called diskless workstation, comes without a disk drive. Common
					operating systems for workstations are UNIX and Windows NT. Like
					PC, workstations are also single-user computers like PC but are
					typically linked together to form a local-area network, although
					they can also be used as stand-alone systems.</p>

				<br> <img alt="Work Station" src="images/work_stations.jpg">

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Minicomputer</h2>
				<p>It is a midsize multi-processing system capable of supporting
					up to 250 users simultaneously.</p>

				<br> <img alt="Mini Computer" src="images/mini_computer.jpg">

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Mainframe
					Computer</h2>
				<p>Mainframe is very large in size and is an expensive computer
					capable of supporting hundreds or even thousands of users
					simultaneously. Mainframe executes many programs concurrently and
					supports many simultaneous execution of programs.</p>
				<br> <img alt="Main Frame Computer" src="images/main_frame.jpg"><br>

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Super
					Computer</h2>
				<p>
					Supercomputers are one of the fastest computers currently
					available. Supercomputers are very expensive and are employed for
					specialized applications that require immense amount of
					mathematical calculations (number crunching).<br> For example,
					weather forecasting, scientific simulations, (animated) graphics,
					fluid dynamic calculations, nuclear energy research, electronic
					design, and analysis of geological data (e.g. in petrochemical
					prospecting).
