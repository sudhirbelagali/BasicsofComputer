				<h1 style="background-color: green; color: white">HISTORY OF
					COMPUTER</h1>

				<p>
					The computer as we know it today had its beginning with a 19th
					century English mathematics professor name Charles Babbage.<br>
					He designed the Analytical Engine and it was this design that the
					basic framework of the computers of today are based on.
				</p>
				<p>
					Generally speaking, computers can be classified into three
					generations. Each generation lasted for a certain period of<br>
					time,and each gave us either a new and improved computer or an
					improvement to the existing computer.
				</p>

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">First
					generation: 1937 - 1946</h2>
				<p>
					In 1937 the first electronic digital computer was built by Dr. John
					V. Atanasoff and Clifford Berry. It was called the Atanasoff-Berry
					Computer (ABC). In 1943 an electronic computer name the Colossus
					was built for the military. Other developments continued until in
					1946 the first general purpose digital computer, the Electronic
					Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was built. It is said
					that this computer weighed 30 tons, and had 18,000 vacuum tubes
					which was used for processing. When this computer was turned on for
					the first time lights dim in sections of Philadelphia. Computers of
					this generation could only perform single task, and they had no
					operating system.<br> The period of first generation was from
					1946-1959. The computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as
					the basic components for memory and circuitry for CPU (Central
					Processing Unit). These tubes, like electric bulbs, produced a lot
					of heat and the installations used to fuse frequently. Therefore,
					they were very expensive and only large organizations were able to
					afford it. In this generation, mainly batch processing operating
					system was used. Punch cards, paper tape, and magnetic tape was
					used as input and output devices. The computers in this generation
					used machine code as the programming language. <br> <img

					The main features of the first generation are
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Vacuum tube technology</li>
					<li>Unreliable</li>
					<li>Supported machine language only</li>
					<li>Very costly</li>
					<li>Generated a lot of heat</li>
					<li>slow input and output devices Huge size</li>
					<li>Need of AC</li>
					<li>Non-portable</li>

					<li>EDVAC</li>
					<li>UNIVAC</li>
					<li>IBM-701</li>
					<li>IBM-650</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Second
					generation: 1947 - 1962</h2>
				<p>
					This generation of computers used transistors instead of vacuum
					tubes which were more reliable. In 1951 the first computer for
					commercial use was introduced to the public; the Universal
					Automatic Computer (UNIVAC 1). In 1953 the International Business
					Machine (IBM) 650 and 700 series computers made their mark in the
					computer world. During this generation of computers over 100
					computer programming languages were developed, computers had memory
					and operating systems. Storage media such as tape and disk were in
					use also were printers for output.<br> The period of second
					generation was from 1959-1965. In this generation, transistors were
					used that were cheaper, consumed less power, more compact in size,
					more reliable and faster than the first generation machines made of
					vacuum tubes. In this generation, magnetic cores were used as the
					primary memory and magnetic tape and magnetic disks as secondary
					storage devices. In this generation, assembly language and
					high-level programming languages like FORTRAN, COBOL were used. The
					computers used batch processing and multiprogramming operating
					system.<br> <img alt="Second Generation"

					features of second generation are
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Use of transistors</li>

					<li>CDC 1604</li>
					<li>CDC 3600</li>
					<li>UNIVAC 1108</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Third
					generation: 1963 - 1971</h2>
				<p>The invention of integrated circuit brought us the third
					generation of computers. With this invention computers became
					smaller, more powerful more reliable and they are able to run many
					different programs at the same time. In1980 Microsoft Disk
					Operating System (MS-Dos) was born and in 1981 IBM introduced the
					personal computer (PC) for home and office use. Three years later
					Apple gave us the Macintosh computer with its icon driven interface
					and the 90s gave us Windows operating system.</p>
				<p>
					As a result of the various improvements to the development of the
					computer we have seen the computer being used in all areas of life.
					It is a very useful tool that will continue to experience new
					development as time passes.<br> The period of third generation
					was from 1965-1971. The computers of third generation used
					Integrated Circuits (ICs) in place of transistors. A single IC has
					many transistors, resistors, and capacitors along with the
					associated circuitry. The IC was invented by Jack Kilby. This
					development made computers smaller in size, reliable, and
					efficient. In this generation remote processing, time-sharing,
					multiprogramming operating system were used. High-level languages
					(FORTRAN-II TO IV, COBOL, PASCAL PL/1, BASIC, ALGOL-68 etc.) were
					used during this generation.<br> <img alt="Thrid Generation"

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Fourth
					Generation 1971-1980</h2>
				<p>
					The period of fourth generation was from 1971-1980. Computers of
					fourth generation used Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits.
					VLSI circuits having about 5000 transistors and other circuit
					elements with their associated circuits on a single chip made it
					possible to have microcomputers of fourth generation.<br>

					Fourth generation computers became more powerful, compact,
					reliable, and affordable. As a result, it gave rise to Personal
					Computer (PC) revolution. In this generation, time sharing, real
					time networks, distributed operating system were used. All the
					high-level languages like C, C++, DBASE etc., were used in this

					Integration) technology, resulting in the production of
					microprocessor chips having ten million electronic components. This
					generation is based on parallel processing hardware and AI
					(Artificial Intelligence) software. AI is an emerging branch in

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Theoretical/experimental
					- Quantum Computer</h2>
				<p>
					Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such
					as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. Computers
					that perform quantum computation are known as quantum computers.
					Quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain
					computational problems, such as integer factorization (which
					underlies RSA encryption), substantially faster than classical
					computers. The study of quantum computing is a subfield of quantum
					information science. Quantum computing began in the early 1980s,
					when physicist Paul Benioff proposed a quantum mechanical model of
					the Turing machine.Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin later suggested
					that a quantum computer had the potential to simulate things that a
					classical computer could not. In 1994, Peter Shor developed a
					quantum algorithm for factoring integers that had the potential to
					decrypt RSA-encrypted communications. Despite ongoing experimental
					progress since the late 1990s, most researchers believe that
					"fault-tolerant quantum computing [is] still a rather distant
					dream". In recent years, investment into quantum computing research
					has increased in both the public and private sector. On 23 October
					2019, Google AI, in partnership with the U.S. National Aeronautics
					and Space Administration (NASA), published a paper in which they
					claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy.[9] While some have
					disputed this claim, it is still a significant milestone in the
					history of quantum computing.<br> There are several models of
					quantum computing, including the quantum circuit model, quantum
					Turing machine, adiabatic quantum computer, one-way quantum
					computer, and various quantum cellular automata. The most widely
					used model is the quantum circuit. Quantum circuits are based on
					the quantum bit, or "qubit", which is somewhat analogous to the bit
					in classical computation. Qubits can be in a 1 or 0 quantum state,
					or they can be in a superposition of the 1 and 0 states. However,
					when qubits are measured the result is always either a 0 or a 1;
					the probabilities of these two outcomes depend on the quantum state
					that they were in immediately prior to the measurement. Computation
					is performed by manipulating qubits with quantum logic gates, which
					are somewhat analogous to classical logic gates. There are
					currently two main approaches to physically implementing a quantum
					computer: analog and digital. Analog approaches are further divided
					into quantum simulation, quantum annealing, and adiabatic quantum
					computation. Digital quantum computers use quantum logic gates to
					do computation. Both approaches use quantum bits or qubits. There
					are currently a number of significant obstacles in the way of
					constructing useful quantum computers. In particular, it is
					difficult to maintain the quantum states of qubits as they are
					prone to quantum decoherence, and quantum computers require
					significant error correction as they are far more prone to errors
					than classical computers.<br> <img alt="Quantum Computer "
