				<p>
					Storage keeps data, information and instructions for use in the
					future. All computers use storage to keep the software that makes
					the hardware work. <br> As a user you store a variety of data
					and information on your computer or on storage media. Storage media
					are the physical materials on which data, information and
					instructions are kept. When a user saves information or data to a
					storage medium he or she is storing a file, and this process is
					called writing. <br> When the file is opened the process is
					called reading.
				</p>
				<h3 style="background-color: blue; color: white">Common storage
					media are</h3>



				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Hard Drive</h2>

				This storage medium which looks like the one below, is a hard drive.
				This medium comes with the computer and is always inside the
				computer.<br> It stores all the programs that the computer
				needs to work. In addition users store their data and information on
				the hard drive.<br> <img src="images/hd.jpg"><br>

					A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk[b] is
					an electro-mechanical data storage device that uses magnetic
					storage to store and retrieve digital data using one or more rigid
					rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material. The
					platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a
					moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter
					surfaces.Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that
					individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order.
					HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data even
					when powered off.<br> Introduced by IBM in 1956, HDDs were the
					dominant secondary storage device for general-purpose computers
					beginning in the early 1960s. HDDs maintained this position into
					the modern era of servers and personal computers, though personal
					computing devices produced in large volume, like cell phones and
					tablets, rely on flash products. More than 224 companies have
					produced HDDs historically, though after extensive industry
					consolidation most units are manufactured by Seagate, Toshiba, and
					Western Digital. HDDs dominate the volume of storage produced
					(exabytes per year) for servers. Though production is growing
					slowly, sales revenues and unit shipments are declining because
					solid-state drives (SSDs) have higher data-transfer rates, higher
					areal storage density, better reliability, and much lower latency
					and access times.<br> The revenues for SSDs, most of which use
					NAND, slightly exceed those for HDDs. Flash storage products had
					more than twice the revenue of hard disk drives as of 2017. Though
					SSDs have four to nine times higher cost per bit, they are
					replacing HDDs in applications where speed, power consumption,
					small size, high capacity and durability are important. Cost per
					bit for SSDs is falling, and the price premium over HDDs has
					narrowed.<br> The primary characteristics of an HDD are its
					capacity and performance. Capacity is specified in unit prefixes
					corresponding to powers of 1000: a 1-terabyte (TB) drive has a
					capacity of 1,000 gigabytes (GB; where 1 gigabyte = 1 billion
					bytes). Typically, some of an HDD's capacity is unavailable to the
					user because it is used by the file system and the computer
					operating system, and possibly inbuilt redundancy for error
					correction and recovery. Also there is confusion regarding storage
					capacity, since capacities are stated in decimal Gigabytes (powers
					of 10) by HDD manufacturers, whereas some operating systems report
					capacities in binary Gibibytes, which results in a smaller number
					than advertised. Performance is specified by the time required to
					move the heads to a track or cylinder (average access time) adding
					the time it takes for the desired sector to move under the head
					(average latency, which is a function of the physical rotational
					speed in revolutions per minute), and finally the speed at which
					the data is transmitted (data rate).<br> The two most common
					form factors for modern HDDs are 3.5-inch, for desktop computers,
					and 2.5-inch, primarily for laptops. HDDs are connected to systems
					by standard interface cables such as PATA (Parallel ATA), SATA
					(Serial ATA), USB or SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) cables.

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">Floppy Disk</h2>
				This storage medium is considered to be a portable storage medium.
				You put it into the computer save your information on it, take it
				out, and take it with you wherever you go. <img
					src="images/floppy.jpg"><br>
				<p>
					A floppy disk, also known as a floppy, diskette, or simply disk, is
					a type of disk storage composed of a disk of thin and flexible
					magnetic storage medium, sealed in a rectangular plastic enclosure
					lined with fabric that removes dust particles. Floppy disks are
					read and written by a floppy disk drive (FDD).<br> Floppy
					disks, initially as 8-inch (203 mm) media[1] and later in 5
					1/4-inch (133 mm) and 3 1/2 inch (90 mm) sizes, were a ubiquitous
					form of data storage and exchange from the mid-1970s into the first
					years of the 21st century.[2] By 2006, computers were rarely
					manufactured with installed floppy disk drives; 3 1/2-inch floppy
					disks can be used with an external USB floppy disk drive, but USB
					drives for 5 1/4-inch, 8-inch, and non-standard diskettes are rare
					to non-existent. These formats are usually handled by older
					equipment.<br> The prevalence of floppy disks in late 20th
					century culture was such that many electronic and software programs
					still use the floppy disks as save icons. While floppy disk drives
					still have some limited uses, especially with legacy industrial
					computer equipment, they have been superseded by data storage
					methods with much greater capacity and transfer speeds, such as USB
					flash drives, memory cards, optical discs and storage available
					through computer networks such as cloud storage.

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">CD &amp; DVD</h2>
				These types of storage media hold much more information than a
				floppy disk. They are also considered portable storage. These types
				of storage media come in different forms. This means that there are
				CDs and DVDs that you can only save information on but you cannot
				erase the information. In addition there are those that can both
				save information on and erase the information you have saved.<br>

					CD stands for Compact Disc was the primary step towards the thought
					of digital coding of the info. It uses a novel methodology of
					coding within which a 14-bit code indicates a computer memory unit
					and this coding technique conjointly helps in error detection. it
					had been an acceptable replacement for the memory device because it
					offered the low-priced answer for storing a big quantity of
					knowledge.<br> DVD stands for Digital Versatile Disk provides
					another for the videotape utilized in tape recorder (Video
					container Recorder) and fixed storage utilized in computer because
					the video disc will acquire seven times larger quantity of the info
					relative to CD. It renders videos with wonderful image quality and
					random access. A video disc is constructed from a similar material
					because the CD however the method and therefore the layers area
					unit completely different, it's used from each of the edges like 2
					CDs area unit projected along. In DVD, RS-PC and EFMplus are used
					as the error correction codes.<br>

				<h2 style="background-color: black; color: white">USB Flash
					Drive</h2>
				This is a storage medium that is very easy to carry around and it
				also holds more data than a floppy disk. As you can see from the
				picture below it is very small when compared with the others.<br>

					A USB flash drive is a data storage device that includes flash
					memory with an integrated USB interface. It is typically removable,
					rewritable and much smaller than an optical disc. Most weigh less
					than 30 g . Since first appearing on the market in late 2000, as
					with virtually all other computer memory devices, storage
					capacities have risen while prices have dropped. As of March 2016,
					flash drives with anywhere from 8 to 256 gigabytes (GB) were
					frequently sold, while 512 GB and 1 terabyte (TB) units were less
					frequent. As of 2018, 2 TB flash drives were the largest available
					in terms of storage capacity. Some allow up to 100,000 write/erase
					cycles, depending on the exact type of memory chip used, and are
					thought to last between 10 and 100 years under normal circumstances
					(shelf storage time).<br> USB flash drives are often used for
					storage, data back-up and transfer of computer files. Compared with
					floppy disks or CDs, they are smaller, faster, have significantly
					more capacity, and are more durable due to a lack of moving parts.
					Additionally, they are immune to electromagnetic interference
					(unlike floppy disks), and are unharmed by surface scratches
					(unlike CDs). Until about 2005, most desktop and laptop computers
					were supplied with floppy disk drives in addition to USB ports, but
					floppy disk drives became obsolete after widespread adoption of USB
					ports and the larger USB drive capacity compared to the "1.44
					megabyte" (1440 kibibyte) 3.5-inch floppy disk.<br> USB flash
					drives use the USB mass storage device class standard, supported
					natively by modern operating systems such as Windows, Linux, macOS
					and other Unix-like systems, as well as many BIOS boot ROMs. USB
					drives with USB 2.0 support can store more data and transfer faster
					than much larger optical disc drives like CD-RW or DVD-RW drives
					and can be read by many other systems such as the Xbox One,
					PlayStation 4, DVD players, automobile entertainment systems, and
					in a number of handheld devices such as smartphones and tablet
					computers, though the electronically similar SD card is better
					suited for those devices.<br> A flash drive consists of a
					small printed circuit board carrying the circuit elements and a USB
					connector, insulated electrically and protected inside a plastic,
					metal, or rubberized case, which can be carried in a pocket or on a
					key chain, for example. The USB connector may be protected by a
					removable cap or by retracting into the body of the drive, although
					it is not likely to be damaged if unprotected. Most flash drives
					use a standard type-A USB connection allowing connection with a
					port on a personal computer, but drives for other interfaces also
					exist. USB flash drives draw power from the computer via the USB
					connection. Some devices combine the functionality of a portable
					media player with USB flash storage; they require a battery only
					when used to play music on the go.
