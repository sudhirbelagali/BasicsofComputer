				<p>Welcome to the class! This is unit one of the course
					Introduction to Computers.This site will give students at the 8th
					9th and 10th grade level a basic working knowledge of what a
					computer is and how it works. After viewing this site students will
					be able to formulate questions about the computer that will
					generate meaningful discussions in the classroom.</p>
				<p>A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out
					sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via
					computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow
					generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs
					enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A
					"complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system
					(main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for
					"full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term
					may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and
					work together, in particular a computer network or computer
					cluster.</p>
				<p>Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of
					industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special
					purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory
					devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design, and
					also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile
					devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and
					it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their
					users.</p>
				<p>Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices.
					Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the abacus aided
					people in doing calculations. Early in the Industrial Revolution,
					some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks,
					such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical
					machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th
					century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were
					developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors
					in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS
					transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip
					technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and
					the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and
					versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever
					since then, with MOS transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace
					(as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution
					during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.</p>
				<P>Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one
					processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in
					the form of a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) microprocessor, along
					with some type of computer memory, typically MOS semiconductor
					memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and
					logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change
					the order of operations in response to stored information.
					Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice,
					joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.),
					and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the
					2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to be
					retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of
					operations to be saved and retrieved.</P>
