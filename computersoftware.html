					SOFTWARE</h1>
				<p>The computer will not work without software. Software also
					call programs are the instructions that tell the computer what to
					do and how o do it. The two main categories of software are system
					software and application software. The system software also called
					the operating system (OS) actually runs the computer. This software
					controls all the operations of the computer and its devices. All
					computers use system software and without the system software the
					application software will not work. The most common OS on a PC is
					the Windows operating system and for the Mac computer it would be
					the Mac operating system.</p>
				<p>Application software is a program that allows users to a
					specific task on the computer. There are a number of different
					types of application software available to do many of the tasks we
					do daily. Four examples of common application software and what
					they are used for are:</p>

				</p>
				<p>It is important to note that when you buy a computer the
					computer comes with the operating system and some software already
					installed. You may have to buy more software and install them on
					the computer. Install means to load the software onto the hard disk
					of the computer so that you can run or use the software.
